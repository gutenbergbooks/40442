<h2>A DAY WITH TENNYSON.</h2>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/illus007.jpg" width="115" height="138" alt="" />
<b><span class="hide">T</span>ENNYSON</b> was no recluse. He
shunned society in the ordinary
London sense, but he welcomed
kindred spirits to his beautiful
home, with large-hearted cordiality.
To be acquainted with
Farringford was in itself a
liberal education. Farringford was an ideal
home for a great poet. To begin with, it
was somewhat secluded and remote from the
world's ways, especially in the early 'fifties,
when the Isle of Wight was much more of a
<i>terra incognita</i> than traffic now permits. One
had to travel down some hundred miles from
town, cross from the quaint little New Forest
port of Lymington to the still quainter little old-world
Yarmouth&mdash;"a medi&aelig;val Venice," the
poet called it&mdash;and then drive some miles to
Freshwater, before one attained the stately
loveliness of Farringford embowered in trees.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where, far from noise and smoke of town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I watch the twilight falling brown<br /></span>
<span class="i4">All around a careless-ordered garden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close to the ridge of a noble down."<br /></span>

<span class="i4"><br />
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="i0">"Groves of pine on either hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To break the blast of winter, stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And further on, the hoary Channel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tumbles a billow on chalk and sand."<br /><br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Lines to the Rev. F. D. Maurice.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The interior of the house&mdash;a very ancient
one&mdash;was no less ideal than its outward aspect,
"it was like a charmed palace, with green
walks without and speaking walls within."
And its occupants crowned all&mdash;the ethereally
lovely mistress with her "tender spiritual
face," and the master, tall, broad-shouldered,
and massive, dark-eyed and dark-browed, his
voice full of deep organ-tones and delicate
inflections, his mind shaped to all fine issues.
"The wisest man," said Thackeray, "that
ever I knew."</p>

<p>Subject to slight inevitable variations, a
certain method and routine governed the day
of Tennyson. He had definite working-times,
indoors and out, and accustomed habits of
family life. The morning brought him letters
from all parts of England: there was hardly
any great man who did not desire to exchange
salutations and discuss world-subjects with a
thinker so far above the rest. The poet, with
the prophetic soul of genius, had always been
well in advance of his times.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rained a ghastly dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the standards of the peoples plunging through the thunderstorm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the war-drum throbbed no longer, and the battle flags were furled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.<br /></span>

<span class="i8"><br />
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forward, let us range,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thro' the shadow of the globe we sweep into the younger day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay."<br /><br /></span>
<span class="i20"><i>Locksley Hall.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The daily papers are somewhat late in
reaching the Isle of Wight: but the poet could
find inspiration even in a source so apparently
prosaic as a <i>Times</i> column. He noted down
some of those valiant and soul-stirring episodes
which go unrecorded save by a passing paragraph:
and the poem which, perhaps, has held
the public fancy longest, the <i>Charge of the
Light Brigade</i>, was written a few minutes after
reading the <i>Times'</i> description of the battle containing
the phrase "Someone had blundered."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>A little while after breakfast, Tennyson
would retire to his "den" on the top storey,
for that "sacred half-hour" devoted to poetical
composition, and assisted by his beloved pipe,
during which nobody dared disturb him. This
den, or study, formed a setting worthy of its
inmate. Every inch of wall was covered with
portrait, sketches, drawings. Almost every
distinguished name of the nineteenth century
was in some manner represented here: the
poet literally worked surrounded by his friends.
And in this congenial atmosphere he devoted
himself to that life-long pursuit of his, as he has
imaged it in the "Gleam," which "flying onward,
wed to the melody, sang through the
world."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whatever respective values a future generation
may set upon Tennyson's work, there
can be little doubt that he himself considered
the <i>Idylls of the King</i>, with its inner spiritual
meanings, as his greatest work. "There is no
single fact or incident in the Idylls," he said,
"which cannot be explained without any mystery
or allegory whatever." Hence their appeal to
the least mystical reader, through sheer beauty
of language and superb pictorial effect. But at
the same time he let it be known that his whole
story was inherently one of pure symbolism:
starting from the suggestion that Arthur represented
conscience. This idea is predominant,
without undue insistence upon it, in <i>Guinevere</i>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yet think not that I come to urge thy crimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did not come to curse thee, Guinevere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, whose vast pity almost makes me die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see thee laying there thy golden head,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Queen Guinevere had fled the court, and sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There in the holy house at Almesbury,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping, none with her save a little maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A novice: one low light betwixt them burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blurred by the creeping mist; for all abroad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath a moon unseen albeit at full,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white mist, like a face-cloth to the face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clung to the dead earth, and the land was still.<br /></span>

<span class="i4"><br />
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There rode an armed warrior to the doors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A murmuring whisper thro' the nunnery ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on a sudden a cry, 'The King.' She sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stiff-stricken, listening; but when armed feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thro' the long gallery from the outer doors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang, coming, prone from off her seat she fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grovell'd with her face against the floor:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There with her milk-white arms and shadowy hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She made her face a darkness from the King;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the darkness heard his armed feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pause by her; then came silence, then a voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monotonous and hollow like a ghost's,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Denouncing judgment, but, tho' changed, the King's.<br /></span>

<span class="i4"><br />
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="i0">My pride in happier summers, at my feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... Let no man dream, but that I love thee still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance, and so thou purify thy soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so thou lean on our fair father Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hereafter in that world where all are pure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We two may meet before high God, and thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt spring to me, and claim me thine, and know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am thine husband&mdash;not a smaller soul,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Never lie by thy side: see thee no more&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell!'<br /></span>
<span class="i10">And while she grovell'd at his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She felt the King's breath wander o'er her neck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the darkness o'er her fallen head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perceived the waving of his hands that blest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">'If I might see his face, and not be seen.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo, he sat on horseback at the door!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And near him the sad nuns with each a light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood, and he gave them charge about the Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To guard and foster her for evermore."<br /><br /></span>

<p>In the course of the day the poet would
devote considerable time and energy to his
favourite exercise of garden work. To plant
trees and shrubs, to roll the lawn, to dig the
kitchen garden, and lovingly to tend the simple
flowers which he had set, was his constant
delight as long as his strength sufficed. He had
a passionate love, and an extraordinary knowledge
of Nature: he rejoiced in watching the
birds in his great cedar, ilex and fir trees, and
his mind was thoroughly attuned to the sweet
influences of colour and foliage. Few else could
have written that unsurpassable lyric, <i>Come
into the Garden, Maud</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come into the garden, Maud,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">To faint in his light, and to die....<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"And the soul of the rose went into my blood,<br /></span>

<p>The same love of Nature made his eye alert
for every obscurest beauty, when he put aside
his gardening tools and started, as was his wont,
for a stroll with some friend along the glorious
cliffs of Freshwater. Those were favoured
folk, who, like Mrs. Thackeray Ritchie,
"walked with Tennyson along High Down,
treading the turf, listening to his talk, while the
gulls came sideways, flashing their white breasts
against the edge of the cliff, and the Poet's cloak
flapped time to the gusts of the west wind."
This cloak and the Poet were practically
synonymous. It figures&mdash;a first edition of it&mdash;in
all the early sketches of him by Spedding,
Fitzgerald, etc. (1830-40) and to the last, one
can hardly imagine him apart from it.</p>

<p>During these quiet rambles he was wont to
discuss with enthusiasm the religious and social
problems of the day; they weighed heavily
upon his thoughtful mind. His philosophy was
a hopeful one, rooted in Christian belief, yet
constantly over-shadowed by fugitive misgivings
and by a sense of the impermanence of human
existence. And while voicing these misgivings
in lines which might give pause to weaker
minds, he never lost his firm faith in right, in
duty, and in ultimate rectification of all apparent
wrong.</p>

<p>But these mysteries of life and death will
not bear too persistent a contemplation: and
presently Tennyson, discarding them in favour
of less sombre subjects, would regale his hearers
with marvellous recitations. "The roll of his
great voice acted sometimes almost like an
incantation." The old-world classical legends
had always found in him a noble exponent;
and nowhere was his peculiar felicity of diction
and delicate sense of sound better exemplified
than in <i>&OElig;none</i>.</p>

<p>The afternoon was spent, sometimes in
further gardening pursuits, sometimes in a
drive around the peaceful Island lanes and
thatch-browed villages; frequently there were
visitors to be met at Yarmouth, where the
Tennysons' carriage might often be seen in the
quaint cobbled streets. The soft and lovely
colouring of the Solent was one to attract the
poet's fancy: and it was after coming freshly
one day into sight of the familiar waters of the
estuary, and a tide, "that moving seems too full
for sound or foam," lapping the lichened sea-walls
of Yarmouth, that he composed, in his
eighty-first year, the verses that he devised to
be placed at the end of his whole collected
poems:&mdash;"Crossing the Bar." The mystic simplicity
of these lines strikes the very key-note
of his character.</p>

<br />SWEET AND LOW.</p>

<p>Tea was served in the drawing-room, "its
oriel window full of green and golden lights, of
the sounds of birds and of the distant sea." The
air of extreme and unstudied simplicity, which
dominated the whole Farringford household,
was just as noticeable here. Tea was a happy
gathering of the family and friends, enlivened
with talk on current topics. The Laureate's
sympathies were wide-reaching, and his conversation,
forcible and often racy, was characterised
by the strongest common-sense. He held
firmly-defined views on all social subjects; and
had declared himself on the question of
"Woman's Rights"&mdash;then comparatively fresh&mdash;at
considerable length in <i>The Princess</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The woman's cause is man's: they rise or sink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together, dwarf'd or god-like, bond or free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... For woman is not undevelopt man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But diverse: could we make her as the man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet Love were slain: his dearest bond is this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not like to like, but like in difference.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet in the long years liker must they grow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man be more of woman, she of man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gain in sweetness and in moral height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor lose the wrestling thews that throw the world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She mental breadth, nor fail in childward care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor lose the childlike in the larger mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at last she set herself to man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like perfect music unto noble words;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so these twain, upon the skirts of Time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit side by side, full-summ'd in all their powers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... Let this proud watchword rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of equal; seeing either sex alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is half itself, and in the marriage ties<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor equal, nor unequal; each fulfils<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defect in each, and always thought in thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purpose in purpose, will in will they grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The single pure and perfect animal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The two-cell'd  heart  beating  with one full stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life."<br /><br /></span>
<span class="i12"><i>The Princess.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poet's ideal of woman was set very
high: he held her to be far above man, morally
and spiritually: and an ideal as perfect as may
well be conceived was daily before his eyes, in
the person of his beautiful wife, with her
pure and saintly face: who was yet</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No angel, but a dearer being, all dipt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Angel instincts, breathing Paradise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Interpreter between the gods and men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who looked all native to her place, and yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On tiptoe seem'd to touch upon a sphere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too gross to tread, and all male minds perforce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sway'd to her from their orbits as they moved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And girdled her with music."<br /><br /></span>
<span class="i12"><i>The Princess.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Later on in the evening, came, perhaps, the
sweetest hour of the day, when, playing and
romping with his little ones, the tall and stately
man became a very child for a while. A
peculiar tenderness towards children was a
distinctive feature of Tennyson: and whether
helping his own boys build stone castles on the
cliff, or frolicking with any village school
children whom he might meet, he was intent
upon giving that joy and laughter to the new
generation which had been denied to his own
childhood. "Make the lives of children as
beautiful and as happy as possible," was a
favourite saying with him. The "Children's
Hour," which Longfellow had sung, was a
radiant hour for him: and most of all he was
enchanted by the sight of little drowsy heads,
asleep in cot or cradle. They inspired some of
his loveliest lyrics, such as:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet and low, sweet and low,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Wind of the western sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low, low, breathe and blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Wind of the western sea!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the rolling waters go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come from the dying moon, and blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Blow him again to me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While my little one, while my pretty one sleeps.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sleep and rest, sleep and rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Father will come to thee soon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rest, rest on mother's breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Father will come to thee soon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father will come to his babe in the nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silver sails all out of the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Under the silver moon:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep my little one, sleep my pretty one, sleep!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the loss of his first-born infant had
touched him with that infinite poignancy of
pathos, which breathes in other lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As thro' the land at eve we went<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And pluck'd the ripened ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We fell out, my wife and I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O! we fell out, I know not why,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And kiss'd again with tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blessings on the falling out<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That all the more endears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we fall out with those we love<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And kiss again with tears!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when we came where lies the child<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We lost in other years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There above the little grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O there above the little grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We kissed again with tears."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The dinner-table was enlivened by Tennyson's
boundless store of anecdote, and keen
sense of humour. It was a "feast of intellect,"
to quote Mrs. Cameron; hour after hour of the
most brilliant conversation. The supernatural
loomed largely. The poet had a <i>penchant</i> for
well-authenticated ghost stories, a deep interest
in psychical phenomena, and an open mind
towards the unknowable. And very strange
tales of dreams, clairvoyance, and occult
happenings, were to be heard at Farringford.
A master of the romantic pervaded by supernatural
elements, he had long since drawn with
deft touches the mysterious confines of "f&auml;ery-lands
forlorn," steeped in the very atmosphere
of dream.</p>

<p>Sitting in his old oak armchair in the drawing-room
after dinner, the Laureate "talked of all
that was in his heart, or read some poem aloud,
with the landscape lying before us like a beautiful
picture framed by the dark-arched bow-window.
His moods," says Mrs. Bradley,
"were so variable, his conversation so earnest,
his knowledge of all things so wide and minute!"
Wide and minute above all, perhaps, was his
acquaintance with Nature. The long quiet
years in Lincolnshire had endowed him with
an almost unrivalled power of detail: and, as
the old Farringford shepherd said in dying,
"Master was a wonderful man for nature and
life." No one quotation could do justice to his
powers: but the lesser music of the countryside
tinkles and ripples audibly through <i>The
Brook</i> and all the exquisite details of its landscape.</p>

<span class="i0">"I come from haunts of coot and hern,<br /></span>

<p>In the course of the evening, the poet would
retire to the "den" for a second "sacred half-hour"
of unbroken silence, into which we need
not follow him. Lastly, when slumber filled
the house, and night hung black above the
trees, he ascended to a platform on the leads
of the house-top, to observe the march and
majesty of the stars. Farringford, it has been
said, "seemed so remote and still, and as
though the jar of the outside world had never
entered it." But in the throbbing starlight, the
sea purring in the distance, the seer on the roof
communing with the mysterious skies above
him, it was more than ever a House of Dream&mdash;a
house whose roof touched heaven. Here
and thus were thrilling <i>nocturnes</i> imagined.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The firefly wakens: waken thou with me.<br /></span>

<span class="i4"><br />

<span class="i0">"Now lies the Earth all Dan&auml;e to the stars,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Now slides the silent meteor on, and leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And slips into the bosom of the lake:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Into my bosom and be lost in me."<br /><br /></span>

<p>And so we leave Alfred Tennyson, at the
end of his day, gazing "forward to the starry
track glimmering up the height beyond," alone
with the Creator.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He lifts me to the golden doors:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The flashes come and go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All heaven bursts her starry floors,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And strews her lights below;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>while the discords of earth are hushed beneath
the magic of the spheral harmony, and "The
Gleam" hovers upward into heaven.</p>
